# Capstone Project
## Build Your Own Web Application
### Treehouse Techdegree Project #12

### Set up your JavaScript-powered web app
* [ ] Build your app using any of the technologies or application frameworks you've learned so far such as React, the MEAN Stack, Express, and Node.js
* View a list of app ideas below the project instructions

### Connect to at least two APIs
* [ ] Display data from at least two other web sites by connecting to their API

### Front end design and layout
* [ ] Use a responsive front end framework like Bootstrap to style your app
* [ ] You can add your own custom CSS to give your app a unique look

### Manage your app's data with a database
* [ ] Use a relational database like MySQL
* [ ] Or use a document-based data store like MongoDB

### Check for issues with your JavaScript code using JSHint, linked in the project resources
* [ ] JSHint may show you some warnings, so make sure to check through those for any potential problems
* [ ] You do not need to fix every warning listed but reviewing them can be useful
### Put your project in a new GitHub repository on your GitHub account
* [ ] See the workshop on Using GitHub for the Degree Program
### App portability
* [ ] Your app should run successfully after running npm install and npm start in a local clone of the GitHub repository

### Deploy your project
* [ ] Make your application available at a public URL, and submit the URL for review
* [ ] See the resources section below for free hosting options
* [ ] View Treehouse tutorials for deploying to Heroku, and using mLab for a MongoDB instance, in the project resources

## Extra Credit

* [ ] Use more than two APIs in your app
* [ ] Write custom CSS to layout and style your app further than the default Bootstrap style
* [ ] Use HTML5 validation to make sure that required fields are filled out and input is formatted correctly
* [ ] Write unit tests for your code using Mocha.js and an assertion library like Chai
